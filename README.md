# Eclipse 4diac FORTE

Eclipse 4diac(TM) FORTE is a run-time environment for executing IEC 61499 control applications developed with 4diac IDE. 4diac FORTE is written in C++ and highly portable. It can be compiled for many different operating systems and especially targets embedded systems like PLCs.

## impl-dds Branch

This branch is the result of my bachelor's thesis.
It implements a communication bridge between ROS (Humble) and this 4diac FORTE.
It uses FastDDS 2.3.6 (version used for that ROS version) to communicate.

The work can be found [here](https://cptpiepmatz.de/ba-tim-hesse.pdf).

## Building 4diac FORTE

### Standard POSIX build

    ./setup_posix.sh
    cd bin/posix
    make

### Resetting CMake files

In case you ran CMake with invalid options it might help
to reset the CMake state by deleting CMake intermediate
files:

    rm -Rf CMakeCache.txt CMakeFiles/

### Building a local RPM

For building local RPMs you can use (tito)[https://github.com/dgoodwin/tito]

    tito build --test --rpm
    
    
### Building 4diac FORTE for Other systems

Detailed information on how to build 4diac FORTE for the different supported operating systems and hardware platforms can be found in our [Installation Documentation](https://www.eclipse.org/4diac/en_help.php?helppage=html/installation/install.html)
